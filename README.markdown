mla_from_scratch   
================
> Machine learning algorithms from scratch

**Why create this project?**   
The idea behind mla_from_scratch is to gain and demo a thorough understanding of 
how a selection of machine learning algorithms work by implementing them from 
scratch.

**How does it compare to scikit-learn?**     
See [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/robrechtdr/mla_from_scratch/blob/master/predictive_performance_comparison.ipynb) for a predictive performance comparison of [mla_from_scratch](https://github.com/robrechtdr/mla_from_scratch/tree/master/mla_from_scratch) with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
